# Dataset Exploration with Ford GoBike System Data
## by Jiarun He


## Dataset

> Ford GoBike System Data : https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

## Features
Trip Duration (seconds) , Start Time and Date , End Time and Date , Start Station ID , Start Station Name , Start Station Latitude , Start Station Longitude , End Station ID , End Station Name, End Station Latitude , End Station Longitude , Bike ID , User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual) , Member Year of Birth, Member Gender

## Summary of Findings

> Conclusion 1 : Most of bike users ride bikes for a short distance around 1.6 KM.
> Conclusion 2: On average customers travel 1.7 km, and subscribers travel 1.6 km on average.
> Conclusion 3: Poeple in age 30-40 consume more than twice of the bike service mileage than people in age group 40-50 in all four seasons. Summer is the most popular season of the year across all age groups.
It's interesting to see people prefer fall weather than spring (more total mileage in fall than spring), I think it's due to the fact that there are more raining days in spring in general than fall.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> As the trip distance has a close relationship with the bike share company's profit, I was trying to find that types of the features will affect trip distance. It turns out, people in age 30-40 travel the most among all age groups, but the mileage use for people between 40-50 dropped to less than half of the mileage consumed by 30-40 age group. The company shall promote biking to make this activity more accessible and user friendly for more senior people. I see Ford GoBike is now promoting E-bikes, which require way less effort than manpowered bikes. I believe this will attract more mid-age users.
